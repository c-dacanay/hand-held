I've spent a lot of time drawing windows. Without fail, they're great still life subjects--they're already composed and every window has its own personality. We've all been looking out the same windows for the same 6 months, so I wanted to generate some alternatives.

This most recent update has a few more assets and a share button where you can send a window (with a song) to a friend. My friend Daniel lended some of their music to vibe to.

[This window](https://c-dacanay.github.io/hand-held/window-maker/#WzIsMSwyLDQsMiwidGhpcyBpcyBteSB3aW5kb3cgaW4gYnJvb2tseW4gLWMiXQ==) is the most realistic, but I think [this one is my favorite](https://c-dacanay.github.io/hand-held/window-maker/#WzIsMCwyLDUsMywiSSBoYXZlIHRoZXNlIHBvdHMgYXQgaG9tZSAtYyJd).

### Note to Max: 
Would love to go over npm and dependencies for local environments! The node modules are here, but I was getting tons of errors when I tried to import functions into my js file.
